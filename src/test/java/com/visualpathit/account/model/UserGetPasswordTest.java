"Scenario 1: Test to validate if correct password is returned for a valid User.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPasswordForValidUser
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method getPassword() returns the correct password for a valid User instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object with a known password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword() method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned password against the known password.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPassword() method correctly retrieves the password for a given User instance. The expected result is the known password, as the User object was created with this password. This test is significant in ensuring that User's password is correctly retrieved when required.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if null is returned when User's password is not set.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPasswordForUserWithoutPassword
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method getPassword() returns null when User's password is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object without setting a password.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword() method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned password is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPassword() method correctly handles the scenario where a User's password is not set. The expected result is null, as the User object was created without a password. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if an empty string is returned when User's password is an empty string.

Details:
  TestName: testGetPasswordForUserWithEmptyPassword
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method getPassword() returns an empty string when User's password is set as an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object with password set as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getPassword() method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned password is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the getPassword() method correctly handles the scenario where a User's password is set as an empty string. The expected result is an empty string, as the User object was created with an empty string as password. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected in such scenarios.
