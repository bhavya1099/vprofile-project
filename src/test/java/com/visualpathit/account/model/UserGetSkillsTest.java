Scenario 1: Testing getSkills method when skills field is set
Details:
  TestName: testGetSkillsWhenFieldIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSkills method when the skills field is set with a value. The target scenario is when a User object's skills field has been set using the setSkills method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and use the setSkills method to set the skills field with a string value.
  Act: Invoke the getSkills method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value from the getSkills method matches the string value set earlier.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getSkills method accurately retrieves the string value set in the skills field. This is significant as it ensures that the getSkills method functions correctly when retrieving data, which is crucial for the User class's operation.
Scenario 2: Testing getSkills method when skills field is not set
Details:
  TestName: testGetSkillsWhenFieldIsNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSkills method when the skills field is not set with a value. The target scenario is when a User object's skills field has not been set using the setSkills method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object without setting the skills field.
  Act: Invoke the getSkills method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value from the getSkills method is null.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getSkills method returns null when the skills field is not set. This is significant as it ensures that the getSkills method handles null values correctly, which is crucial for the User class's robustness.
Scenario 3: Testing getSkills method when skills field is set with an empty string
Details:
  TestName: testGetSkillsWhenFieldIsSetWithEmptyString
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSkills method when the skills field is set with an empty string. The target scenario is when a User object's skills field has been set using the setSkills method with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and use the setSkills method to set the skills field with an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getSkills method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value from the getSkills method is an empty string.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the getSkills method accurately retrieves an empty string when the skills field is set as such. This is significant as it ensures that the getSkills method handles empty string values correctly, which is crucial for the User class's robustness.
