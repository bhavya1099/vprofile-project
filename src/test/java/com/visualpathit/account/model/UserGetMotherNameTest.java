Scenario 1: Test to check if the getMotherName method returns the correct mother's name
Details:
  TestName: testGetMotherNameReturnsCorrectName.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getMotherName method is functioning correctly and returning the correct mother's name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a User object and set the motherName field to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getMotherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known mother's name.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getMotherName method returns the correct mother's name. The expected result is the known mother's name because that is the value that was set in the User object. This test is significant in ensuring that the User object correctly stores and retrieves the user's mother's name.
Scenario 2: Test to check if the getMotherName method returns null when the mother's name is not set
Details:
  TestName: testGetMotherNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getMotherName method returns null when the mother's name is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a User object without setting the motherName field.
  Act: Invoke the getMotherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getMotherName method returns null when the mother's name is not set. This is the expected result because no value was set for the mother's name in the User object. This test is significant in ensuring that the User object correctly handles cases where the mother's name is not set.
Scenario 3: Test to check if the getMotherName method returns an empty string when the mother's name is set to an empty string
Details:
  TestName: testGetMotherNameReturnsEmptyStringWhenSetToEmpty.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getMotherName method returns an empty string when the mother's name is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a User object and set the motherName field to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getMotherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getMotherName method returns an empty string when the mother's name is set to an empty string. This is the expected result because an empty string was set for the mother's name in the User object. This test is significant in ensuring that the User object correctly handles cases where the mother's name is set to an empty string.
