Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns the correct father's name
Details:
  TestName: testGetFatherNameReturnsCorrectName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFatherName method correctly returns the name of the user's father. The target scenario is when the user's father's name has been set and we want to retrieve it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object and set the father's name using the setFatherName method.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned father's name is the same as the one set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFatherName method correctly retrieves the father's name that has been set. This is significant as it confirms that the User object correctly stores and retrieves the father's name, which is a crucial part of the user's profile.
Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns null when the father's name has not been set
Details:
  TestName: testGetFatherNameReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFatherName method returns null when the father's name has not been set. The target scenario is when a new User object is created and the father's name has not been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object without setting the father's name.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned father's name is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFatherName method correctly handles the case where the father's name has not been set, by returning null. This is significant as it confirms that the User object correctly handles the case where not all information has been set, which is a common scenario when a new User object is created.
Scenario 3: Test to check if the method returns the correct father's name after it has been updated
Details:
  TestName: testGetFatherNameReturnsUpdatedName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFatherName method correctly returns the updated father's name. The target scenario is when the user's father's name has been updated and we want to retrieve the new name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a User object and set the father's name using the setFatherName method. Then, update the father's name using the setFatherName method again.
  Act: Invoke the getFatherName method on the User object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned father's name is the same as the updated one.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFatherName method correctly retrieves the updated father's name. This is significant as it confirms that the User object correctly updates and retrieves the father's name, which is an important part of the user's profile that may need to be updated.
