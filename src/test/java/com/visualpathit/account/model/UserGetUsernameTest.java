"Scenario 1: Test to Verify the Default Username

Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultUsername
  Description: This test is meant to check the default username of a newly created User object. The target scenario is the initialization of a User object and the retrieval of the default username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object.
  Act: Invoke the getUsername method without setting a username.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the username is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the User object's default username is null, which is expected since we did not set a username. This test is significant in ensuring that the User object is initialized with the correct default values.

Scenario 2: Test to Verify the Correct Username is Returned

Details:
  TestName: verifyCorrectUsernameIsReturned
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the correct username is returned after it has been set. The target scenario is the setting of a username and the subsequent retrieval of that username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and set a username.
  Act: Invoke the getUsername method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned username matches the set username.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUsername method returns the correct username that was set. This test is significant in ensuring that the getUsername method accurately retrieves the User object's username.

Scenario 3: Test to Verify that getUsername Handles Null

Details:
  TestName: verifyGetUsernameHandlesNull
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getUsername method handles null values correctly. The target scenario is the setting of a null username and the subsequent retrieval of that username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new User object and set the username as null.
  Act: Invoke the getUsername method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned username is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getUsername method returns null when the username is set as null. This test is significant in ensuring that the getUsername method correctly handles null values.
